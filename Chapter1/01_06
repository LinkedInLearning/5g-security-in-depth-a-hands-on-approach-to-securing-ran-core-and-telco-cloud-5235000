# 🔍 Nmap Testing Open5GS Inside AWS EC2

This guide explains how to use Nmap from inside an EC2 instance where Open5GS is installed. You’ll scan internal services, detect potential vulnerabilities, and confirm port exposure — all from a real-world telco cloud setup.

## 🛠️ What You Can Do Inside EC2

Running Nmap from within your EC2 instance allows you to scan:

- `localhost` services (e.g., `127.0.0.1`)
- The EC2 private IP (e.g., `172.31.x.x`)
- Other internal services (e.g., UERANSIM, Docker containers, or Kubernetes pods)

⚠️ This won't show what the public internet can access, but it's valuable for internal security assessments.

## 📍 What to Scan

Assuming Open5GS is running on:

- `127.0.0.1` (loopback)
- `172.31.22.231` (your EC2 private IP)

## 📌 Recommended Nmap Commands (Inside EC2)

### 🔹 Scan TCP Ports for Open5GS Services

```bash
nmap -sS 127.0.0.1

## SAMPLE OUTPUT

PORT     STATE SERVICE
22/tcp   open  ssh
2381/tcp open  compaq-https
3389/tcp open  ms-wbt-server
5000/tcp open  upnp
5001/tcp open  commplex-link
9099/tcp open  unknown
9200/tcp open  wap-wsp
